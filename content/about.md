# Hi there

My name is Inu John (he/him). I'm a software developer, and painter. Welcome to my space where I'll "not so frequently" give updates about the tools I use for development, project I've made, and also a new painting or book I found.

I'm also very passionate about making contributions to open-source projects â€” just to keep the sauce of the community alive. I'm also a creator of open-source projects with 5 stars on github.

Below are my handles, if you need to reach out to me:
